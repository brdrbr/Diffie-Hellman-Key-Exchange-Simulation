# Diffie-Hellman-Key-Exchange-Simulation
A simulation of the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol and the 2 parties communication process implemented in Python.
The program acts as a way of communication between the two parties. It first computes the hashed keys for both parties and then the commununication phase starts.
The cyphertexts and the keys for each phases are written inside a .txt file. The other user takes the message input of the other user from this .txt file in order for decryption.
After decryption the user send his own message to the text file in its encryption form and the process continues as usual.
